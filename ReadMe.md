## Kotlin Battle Ground

Coding . . . it hurts and humbles. For every release, a bug, For every test suite a workaround. Beyond the horizon awaits, a new release, a new compiler, for redemption, for glory, for immortality.
The brave will take to the editors, as warriors to battle, shoulder to shoulder, face to face. The hunger, the determination to push limits. To fight, code, debug, test, build, release and celebrate!
as the new version dawns, new coders will rise, new teams will captivate, new companies will rock, new challenges will emerge, new battles will be fought, in the name of glory, in the name of honor,
in the name of software. The code we love, the code we live for. Every challenge, every cheer, every minute, every second, the best language, our language. We are Kotlin
